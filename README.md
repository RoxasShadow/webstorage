Webstorage
==========

This is an old project buried by the sand of times.

Through the signup, you can follow other registered users, read and send them PMs, have a public profile and upload your files in your repository.
Repositories can be public or private and in your home page, you can read in live what your
friends are uploading in their repository.
With the files you upload, you are able to download, delete and share them with whoever you
want.

Being an old project, fork of [Ocarina 2](https://github.com/RoxasShadow/OcarinaProject),
I can assure nothing, so gl.

A live demo is available [here](http://www.giovannicapuano.net/webstorage/).
