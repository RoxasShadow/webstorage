==========

This is an old project buried by the sand of times.

Through the signup, you can follow other registered users, read and send them PMs, have a public profile and upload files in your repository.
Repositories can be public or private and you can read in live what your friends are uploading in their repository.
You are able to download, delete and share your uploaded files with whoever you want.

Being an old project -fork of [Ocarina 2](https://github.com/RoxasShadow/OcarinaProject)- I can assure nothing, so gl.

A live demo is also available [here](http://www.giovannicapuano.net/webstorage/).
